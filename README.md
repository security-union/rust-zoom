# How to test?

## Setup 
Technically you could test this with a single computer, but it is more fun if you use 2+.

## Steps

1. Open chrome://flags on all the computers that you want to use to test the tele-conferencing system, add the ip of the computer that you will use as the server to the Insecure origins treated as secure list.

2. Start the servers on the computer that you intent to use as the server using `make up` (requires docker).

3. Connect all computers to `http://<server-ip>/meeting/<username>/<meeting-id>`

4. Make sure that you "allow" access to your mic and camera:

5. Click connect on both browsers, and enjoy:
